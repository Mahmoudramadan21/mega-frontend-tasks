# Week 3 – My Dream Portfolio  
CSS Mastery Challenge (First Blood)

**MEGA TEAM Frontend Track – 2025**

You have already finished all HTML lessons and built a solid, semantic Personal Portfolio.  
Now it’s time to make it **beautiful** using everything you learned in **CSS Lessons #01 – #16** (Elzero Web School).

### Goal
Upgrade your Week 1 Personal Portfolio (or rebuild it) into a colorful, professional-looking website using **only pure CSS** – no Flexbox, no Grid, no frameworks.

### Project Structure
```
my-dream-portfolio/
├── index.html
├── style.css                  ← All your CSS goes here
├── assets/
│   ├── images/                ← Profile picture, background images, icons
│   └── resume.pdf
├── README.md                  ← This file + proof of work
└── .gitignore (optional)
```

### Required CSS Features  
You **must** use every item below at least once:

| # | Property / Concept                          | Where you can use it (examples)                  |
|---|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | External CSS file + proper linking          | `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`      |
| 2 | Color & background-color                    | Body, sections, header                           |
| 3 | background-image + repeat/position/size      | Hero section or full-page background             |
| 4 | padding (all sides + shorthand)             | Cards, sections, containers                      |
| 5 | margin (all sides + shorthand)              | Space between sections                           |
| 6 | border + border-radius                      | Profile picture (circle), buttons, cards         |
| 7 | outline                                     | Focus style on links/buttons or a card           |
| 8 | width, height, max-width                    | Container, images, profile picture               |
| 9 | display: block / inline / inline-block      | Skills list, social icons, navigation items     |
|10 | overflow, overflow-x, overflow-y            | Long bio text, project description box           |
|11 | visibility: hidden or display: none         | Hide something temporarily (e.g., a secret note)|
|12 | Grouping selectors & nesting                | `.header a`, `.skills li`, etc.                  |
|13 | Clean class names (BEM or similar)          | `.hero__title`, `.card--primary`, etc.           |

### Minimum Design Requirements
- Navigation bar clearly visible and styled  
- Profile picture is **perfectly circular** with a border  
- At least **5 different background colors or images** across sections  
- Sections are properly spaced (no elements touching each other)  
- Skills / social links are displayed **horizontally** using `inline-block`  
- The page should look decent on both mobile and desktop (basic responsiveness with `max-width`)  
- All CSS must be in the external `style.css` file

### README.md Must Contain
1. Live demo link (GitHub Pages or Netlify)  
2. **Before & After** screenshots (pure HTML → with your CSS)  
3. A simple table showing where you used each required property (template below):

```markdown
| Property              | Used On                     | Example Value          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| background-image      | Hero section                | url('assets/bg.jpg')   |
| border-radius         | Profile picture             | 50%                    |
| display: inline-block | Skills list items           | inline-block           |
| ...                   | ...                         | ...                    |
```

### Bonus (Extra Respect)
- Hover effects on links/buttons  
- Use `outline` instead of `border` in one place and explain why  
- Creative use of `overflow` (e.g., scrollable project box)  
- Make the navigation bar feel “fixed” using a clever margin/padding trick

### Submission Checklist
- [ ] Live demo works perfectly  
- [ ] All 13 required CSS concepts are used and listed in README  
- [ ] Before/After screenshots included  
- [ ] Clean code with comments when needed  
- [ ] Repository is public and named `my-dream-portfolio`

### Deadline
**Friday – 12:00 AM (midnight) Cairo time**

The top submissions will get a detailed video review from me + a special shout-out in the team.

Take your plain HTML page and turn it into something you’d proudly show anyone.  
This is where the real fun begins.

Good luck!
