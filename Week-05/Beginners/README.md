# Week 05 – Modern Card Collection (Mini Project)
**MEGA TEAM Frontend Track – Beginners Level 2026**

### Goal
Create a clean, modern page showing 3–5 similar cards.  
Use **only** the new CSS concepts from Lessons #39 to #53.

### Project Name
`modern-cards-mini`

### What You Need to Build
- One `<h1>` title at the top (e.g. "Our Services" or "Key Features")
- A container holding 3 to 5 cards
- Each card contains:
  - Small image or icon (top)
  - Short title (`<h3>`)
  - 1–2 sentence description (`<p>`)
  - Simple button at the bottom

### Required CSS Concepts – Use each at least once

| Lesson | Concept                        | Where to Apply It (simple examples)                     |
|--------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| #39    | border-radius                  | Round corners of cards and images                       |
| #40    | box-shadow                     | Normal shadow + stronger shadow on hover                |
| #41    | box-sizing: border-box         | Apply globally `* { box-sizing: border-box; }`          |
| #42    | transition                     | Smooth change on hover (shadow, scale, color)           |
| #43    | !important                     | Use once only – add comment explaining why              |
| #44    | Margin collapse                | Show the problem between cards + fix it (with comment)  |
| #45    | CSS Variables                  | Define at least 5 variables in `:root`                  |
| #46–49 | Flexbox – Parent properties    | Make cards container `display: flex`, wrap, justify...  |
| #50–53 | Flexbox – Child properties     | Use grow / shrink / basis / order / align-self on cards |
